# DNEngine
This is a project attempting to create a replacement engine for Duke3D.

The purpose is to create a true 3D engine with friendlier code readability, and probably won't be a true "port" of the game.

Currently doesn't really do anything. Just a bit of basic technical implementation.

The license is GNU GPL Version 2 as I plan to borrow some code from miscellaneous Duke ports, namely eduke32, which follows this license.

Thirdparty libraries may have their own respective licenses.
